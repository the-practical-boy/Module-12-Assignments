    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It serves as a central repository for various types of information, allowing users to interact with the data in a systematic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a structured query language to define and manipulate data. They are based on a tabular schema, with data organized into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases are known for their ability to ensure data integrity through relationships between tables and support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are designed to scale horizontally and are often used in scenarios where high availability and scalability are crucial, such as web applications, big data, and real-time analytics. NoSQL databases come in various types, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases, each optimized for specific use cases and data models."
